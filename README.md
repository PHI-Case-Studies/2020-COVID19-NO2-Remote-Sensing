# Case Study: 2020 COVID19: Processing Nitrogen Dioxide Remote Sensing Data

## About this Digital Case Study

This is a **digital case study** built with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and Docker to support COVID 19 studies on reduction of pollution from national lockdowns.

### Special Note
This advanced but introductory set of notebooks assumes a computing environment with at least 16GB of RAM, adequate internet bandwidth and 300GB of unused disk space. The NetDC4 files from the Sentinel 5P satellite are large-sized, each one about 400MB. For demonstration purposes, in Pipeline 1, 4 NetCD4 files (data for 1 day for African continent) are downloaded, then converted to Pandas DataFrames, which are also saved on file. In Pipeline 2, 8 weeks worth of data are downloaded (~105GB) for the African continent (~31 files per week), 4 weeks in 2019 and 4 weeks in 2020.
